At the end of each game, GameEnhancer provides players with a detailed summary of the monsters and items that appeared on the map, including their quantities. This gives players a better understanding of what they encountered and collected during the session.

This feature allows players to see their location on the in-game map, improving navigation. Additionally, it slightly increases the map's light brightness to make it easier to read and understand, with configuration options for optimal visibility.

For parties with more than four players, this feature adds four additional glowstick colors, making it easier to identify teammates and follow their path.<br>
⚠️However, if you're hosting a game, all players joining the session must also have the mod installed. Otherwise, when using one of the new glowstick colors, players without the mod will be kicked from the game.⚠️
